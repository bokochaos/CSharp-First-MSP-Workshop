# CSharp-First-MSP-Workshop
MSP @ UCI's First Workshop! Hosted Jan. 2016


Hello everyone!

This is a C# program developed in VISUAL STUDIO COMMUNITY 2015.
I do not have other versions installed, so I will have to assume this works for the most part.

For Windows Users:
1) Go to https://www.dreamspark.com/Product/Product.aspx?productid=101
    1A) Feel free to register for Dreamspark while you're at the site! More workshops coming soon!
2) Download the Visual Studio Community 2015 edition. (Product key is included)
    2A) Be aware that this is an initial 3~4GB download with about a 16GB install for some features.
3) Once installed, click File>New>Project from existing code.
4) Set project to Visual C#, direct the program to the folder, and name it GradeCalculator
    4A) Set this to console application

For Mac Users:
1) Go to http://www.mono-project.com/
2) Download the installer and install on your machine
3) Run the Console "Hello World" application at http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/mono-basics/
4) Save the project directory in your Mono folder
    4A) Alternatively, direct mono to the project
5) Follow the workshop using your favorite code editors until you need to compile!

For any further questions, please save them for the workshop.

Any questions after the workshop can be posted in the "Microsoft at Uc Irvine" Facebook group!
I will be more than glad to try and help you with the project afterwards if you still have an interest!
